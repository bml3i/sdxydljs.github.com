## Estimate

Based on the scale of enhancements, it could be estimated by module/function/fields. It is always based on the experience of each developer, the estimate should contain the analyzing/developing/testing/deploying time. And should analyze and show system administrator the risk of each enhancement. 

## Create & Trace Tickets

Once system administrator approved our estimation, we should generate a new ticket in mantis system to trace each issue. When an issue's status had been changed, the related ticket needs to be changed accordingly. 

## Development

Follow the coding standards and naming conventions, all the codes/scripts should be stored in subversion server. 

## Testing

QA/UAT should be fully tested before deploying to production environment. After deployment, should do a smoke test on production environment. 

## Deployment

Always need to get the approval of the system administrator first, and then need to apply for a windows time from Broad Aspect to do such deployment. In the end, send a notification email to system administrator.
